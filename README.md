The Library Management System is a web-based application developed using Servlets, JSP, and MySQL, designed to automate library operations efficiently. It features User Registration, Login, and Forgot Password functionality, along with Book Management (CRUD operations: Add, Update, Delete, Find, and Display books) and Search Functionality (search books by title). The system follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and uses JDBC for seamless database interactions, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval. The Servlet-JSP architecture dynamically generates content, while session management and authentication enhance security. With MySQL integration for persistent data storage, this project offers a scalable and maintainable solution for library automation.
